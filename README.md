# Wobbly ML
A ML library based on the [Neural Networks From Scratch](https://nnfs.io) book.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.13 minimum

## Setup
Install the following libraries:
```
$ pip install numpy
```
Install wobbly-ml as a dev library:
```
$ sh install.sh
```

Running the examples will require additional libraries:
```
$ pip install matplotlib nnfs opencv-contrib-python-headless
``` 

## Usage
Run the example `regression.py` file:
```
$ python3 regression.py
```

## Testing
Errr... No tests yet.

## Why?
The goal of this project was to try to understand what a neural network is and how it is built. I wanted to build this simple and small library because I did not agree with how the book structured the project. That was a good exercise because I had to think careful about where each functionality belonged to.

In the future, as I begin to understand more, I will continually build on this library and add more features.

## What's the end goal?
Eventually, I want this to contain all the things that I will learn as I progress further with ML.
I want it to run on both the CPU and GPU.

## Why WobblyML?
I don't expected this to be stable and production ready.

Let's just have some fun and explore!
